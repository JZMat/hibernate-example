There are a few areas that could be improved:

1. **Input Handling**: You're handling user input with try-catch blocks, which is good. However, you might consider adding additional validation to ensure that the user input is within acceptable ranges or formats, especially when selecting options like bank accounts or owners.

2. **Error Handling**: While you're catching `InputMismatchException`, it might be beneficial to provide more informative error messages to the user, guiding them on what went wrong and how they can correct it.

3. **Code Reusability**: There are some repetitive code blocks, such as printing the list of owners or bank accounts. Consider refactoring these into separate methods to improve code readability and maintainability.

4. **Exception Handling**: When accessing elements from lists (e.g., bank accounts or owners), it's good practice to handle potential `IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions` more gracefully to provide a better user experience.

5. **User Interface Enhancement**: Providing a more user-friendly interface with clearer instructions and options can enhance the user experience.

6. **Code Comments**: Adding comments to explain complex logic or important decisions can help other developers (including your future self) understand the code more easily.



For 'BankAccountMenu' class:

Redundancy in displayFormattedBankAccounts and depositFunds methods: Both methods call retrieveAllBankAccounts() to get all bank accounts.
However, in depositFunds, you’re also calling bankAccountService.getAllBankAccounts() before displayFormattedBankAccounts(). You can remove the call
to bankAccountService.getAllBankAccounts() in depositFunds to avoid redundancy.

Redundancy in assignOwnerToBankAccount method: Similar to the first point, you’re calling bankAccountService.getAllBankAccounts() and then
retrieveAllBankAccounts(). You can remove the call to bankAccountService.getAllBankAccounts() to avoid redundancy.

Redundancy in formatBankAccountAndHeader method: You’re creating the separator string every time the method is called. Since the separator doesn’t
change, you can make it a class-level constant to avoid recreating it every time.

Redundancy in getOwnersAsString method: You’re appending a comma and a space to the ownerNames string builder and then removing the last two
characters. Instead, you can use a StringJoiner with a delimiter of ", " to avoid the need to remove the last two characters.

Redundancy in run method: The returnToMainMenu flag is set to false at the end of the run method. However, this is not necessary because the while
loop will only exit when returnToMainMenu is true, so setting it to false afterwards is redundant.
